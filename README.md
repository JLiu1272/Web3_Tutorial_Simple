# Web3 + React + Typescript Truffle Box 

Note: Please use code in master branch 

While learning how to develop DApp with Web3, I wasn't able to find a Truffle box that used the most up to date Web3 and Typescript conventions. I hope that the people after me who are starting DApp development can benefit from an easy to use truffle box that uses the most up to date Web3 and Typescript versions, and expedite their learning experience with Smart Contracts and Web3.
